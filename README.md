# MilleEngine

Mille Engine is a personal project I began to work on since 2019. I use it as a playground for realizing some features about real-time rendering, raytracing, simulation and physcics.  

## Features
- Vulkan rendering backend
- Cross Platform shader complilation
- Support glTF format model and animation 
- Rendering:
  - Shadow Mapping
  - Cascaded Shadow Mapping
  - Defferred Shading
  - Physically-based shading model
  - Indirect Draw
  - Mesh Shader
  - GPU-based particle simulation
